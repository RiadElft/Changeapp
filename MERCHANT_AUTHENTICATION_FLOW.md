# Merchant Authentication Flow

## Overview

The مودع application is now a merchant-focused platform where store owners can sign up to help their customers save spare change. The landing page is designed specifically for merchants who want to use the app in their stores, with a streamlined signup/signin process.

## New Design Approach
